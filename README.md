# NLTK and spaCy Stemming Analysis
- This repository provides code and analysis comparing the stemming capabilities of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy. Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form, which can be useful in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Stemming Analysis
- The code in this repository demonstrates how NLTK and spaCy perform stemming on different datasets. It includes examples of using both libraries to extract word stems, compare the results, and evaluate their effectiveness for specific use cases.

## Getting Started
- To get started with the code, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/VigneshwaranBS/NLTK-and-Spacy-Stemming-Analysis.git
```

## After cloning the repository, you can run the analysis using the provided scripts and datasets.

## Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8
-NLTK
- spaCy
You can install NLTK and spaCy using pip:

```
pip install nltk
```
```
pip install spacy
```

- Additionally, you will need to download the NLTK data and spaCy language model. Run the following commands to download them:

```
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
```
```
python -m spacy download en
```

Additionally, you will need to download the relevant language models for spaCy. Refer to the spaCy documentation for instructions on downloading the models.

## Running the Analysis
- The repository includes example scripts for running the stemming analysis using NLTK and spaCy. These scripts provide sample code for loading datasets, performing stemming, and comparing the results. You can modify these scripts or create your own to suit your specific needs.

## Contributing
- If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes. Once you have made your changes, submit a pull request, and it will be reviewed by the project maintainers.


## Acknowledgments
- This project makes use of the NLTK and spaCy libraries. Special thanks to the developers and contributors of these libraries for their valuable work in the field of natural language processing.
